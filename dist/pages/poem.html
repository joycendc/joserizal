              <h2 class="desc">
                <p>
                  His friend Mariano Ponce gave it the title of MI ULTIMO ADIOS,
                  as it originally had none Farewell, my adored Land, region of
                  the sun caressed, Pearl of the Orient Sea, our Eden lost, With
                  gladness I give you my Life, sad and repressed; And were it
                  more brilliant, more fresh and at its best, I would still give
                  it to you for your welfare at most.

                  <br /><br />On the fields of battle, in the fury of fight,
                  Others give you their lives without pain or hesitancy, The
                  place does not matter: cypress laurel, lily white, Scaffold,
                  open field, conflict or martyrdom's site, It is the same if
                  asked by home and Country.

                  <br /><br />I die as I see tints on the sky b'gin to show And
                  at last announce the day, after a gloomy night; If you need a
                  hue to dye your matutinal glow, Pour my blood and at the right
                  moment spread it so, And gild it with a reflection of your
                  nascent light!

                  <br /><br />My dreams, when scarcely a lad adolescent, My
                  dreams when already a youth, full of vigor to attain, Were to
                  see you, gem of the sea of the Orient, Your dark eyes dry,
                  smooth brow held to a high plane Without frown, without
                  wrinkles and of shame without stain.

                  <br /><br />My life's fancy, my ardent, passionate desire,
                  Hail! Cries out the soul to you, that will soon part from
                  thee; Hail! How sweet 'tis to fall that fullness you may
                  acquire; To die to give you life, 'neath your skies to expire,
                  And in your mystic land to sleep through eternity!

                  <br /><br />If over my tomb some day, you would see blow, A
                  simple humble flow'r amidst thick grasses, Bring it up to your
                  lips and kiss my soul so, And under the cold tomb, I may feel
                  on my brow, Warmth of your breath, a whiff of your tenderness.

                  <br /><br />Let the moon with soft, gentle light me descry,
                  Let the dawn send forth its fleeting, brilliant light, In
                  murmurs grave allow the wind to sigh, And should a bird
                  descend on my cross and alight, Let the bird intone a song of
                  peace o'er my site.

                  <br /><br />Let the burning sun the raindrops vaporize And
                  with my clamor behind return pure to the sky; Let a friend
                  shed tears over my early demise; And on quiet afternoons when
                  one prays for me on high, Pray too, oh, my Motherland, that in
                  God may rest I.

                  <br /><br />Pray thee for all the hapless who have died, For
                  all those who unequalled torments have undergone; For our poor
                  mothers who in bitterness have cried; For orphans, widows and
                  captives to tortures were shied, And pray too that you may see
                  your own redemption.

                  <br /><br />And when the dark night wraps the cemet'ry And
                  only the dead to vigil there are left alone, Don't disturb
                  their repose, don't disturb the mystery: If you hear the
                  sounds of cittern or psaltery, It is I, dear Country, who, a
                  song t'you intone.

                  <br /><br />And when my grave by all is no more remembered,
                  With neither cross nor stone to mark its place, Let it be
                  plowed by man, with spade let it be scattered And my ashes ere
                  to nothingness are restored, develops withdiet and
                  satisfaction, that might not influence onmany wonder why
                  wouldst thou art thou be stopped. Let them turn to dust to
                  cover your earthly space.

                  <br /><br />Then it doesn't matter that you should forget me:
                  Your atmosphere, your skies, your vales I'll sweep; Vibrant
                  and clear note to your ears I shall be: Aroma, light, hues,
                  murmur, song, moanings deep, Constantly repeating the essence
                  of the faith I keep.

                  <br /><br />My idolized Country, for whom I most gravely pine,
                  Dear Philippines, to my last goodbye, oh, harken There I leave
                  all: my parents, loves of mine, I'll go where there are no
                  slaves, tyrants or hangmen Where faith does not kill and where
                  God alone does reign.

                  <br /><br />Farewell, parents, brothers, beloved by me,
                  Friends of my childhood, in the home distressed; Give thanks
                  that now I rest from the wearisome day; Farewell, sweet
                  stranger, my friend, who brightened my way; Farewell, to all I
                  love. To die is to rest.
