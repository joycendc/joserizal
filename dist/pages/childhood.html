                He was baptized JOSE RIZAL MERCADO at the Catholic of Calamba by

                When he was four years old, his sister Conception, the eight
                child in the Rizal family, died at the age of three. It was on
                this occasion that Rizal remembered having shed real tears for
                the first time.

                During this time his mother taught him how to read and write.
                His father hired a classmate by the name of Leon Monroy who, for
                five months until his (Monroy) death, taught Rizal the rudiments
                of Latin.<br /><br />
                At about this time two of his mother’s cousin frequented
                Calamba. Uncle Manuel Alberto, seeing Rizal frail in body,
                concerned himself with the physical development of his young
                nephew and taught the latter love for the open air and developed
                in him a great admiration for the beauty of nature, while Uncle
                Gregorio, a scholar, instilled into the mind of the boy love for
                education. He advised Rizal: "Work hard and perform every task
                very carefully; learn to be swift as well as thorough; be
                independent in thinking and make visual pictures of everything."

                With his father, Rizal made a pilgrimage to Antipolo to fulfill
                the vow made by his mother to take the child to the Shrine of
                the Virgin of Antipolo should she and her child survive the
                ordeal of delivery which nearly caused his mother’s life.<br /><br />
                From there they proceeded to Manila and visited his sister
                Saturnina who was at the time studying in the La Concordia
                College in Sta. Ana.

                At the age of eight, Rizal wrote his first poem entitled "Sa
                Aking Mga Kabata." The poem was written in tagalog and had for
                its theme "Love of One’s Language."
