        <p class="mb">
          There were at least nine women linked with Rizal; namely Segunda
          Katigbak, Leonor Valenzuela, Leonor Rivera, Consuelo Ortiga, O-Sei
          San, Gertrude Beckette, Nelly Boustead, Suzanne Jacoby and Josephine
          Bracken. These women might have been beguiled by his intelligence,
          charm and wit.

              <h2 class="desc">
                Segunda Katigbak was her puppy love. Unfortunately, his first
                love was engaged to be married to a town mate- Manuel Luz. After
                his admiration for a short girl in the person of Segunda, then
                came Leonor Valenzuela, a tall girl from Pagsanjan. Rizal send
                her love notes written in invisible ink, that could only be
                deciphered over the warmth of the lamp or candle. He visited her
                on the eve of his departure to Spain and bade heckett
                <br /><br />can turn back to thisstage, by the speed of the
                stomach. While Rizal was in London annotating the Sucesos de las
                Islas Filipinas, he boarded in the house of the Beckett family,
                within walking distance of the British Museum. Gertrude, a
                blue-eyed and buxom girl was the oldest of the three Beckett
                daughters. She fell in love with Rizal. Tottie helped him in his
                painting and sculpture. But Rizal suddenly left London for Paris
                to avoid Gertrude, who was seriously in love with him. Before
                leaving London, he was able to finish the group carving of the
                Beckett sisters. He gave the group carving to Gertrude as a sign
                of their brief relationship.

              <h2 class="desc">
                Rizal having lost Leonor Rivera, entertained the thought of
                courting other ladies. While a guest of the Boustead family at
                their residence in the resort city of B left Europe.

              <h2 class="desc">
                In 1890, Rizal moved to Brussels because of the high cost of
                living in Paris. In Brussels, he lived in the boarding house of
                the two Jacoby sisters. In time, they fell deeply in love with
                each other. Suzanne cried when Rizal left Brussels and wrote him
                when he was in Madrid.

              <h2 class="desc">
                In the last days of February 1895, while still in Dapitan, Rizal
                met an 18-year old petite Irish girl, with bold blue eyes, brown
                hair and a happy disposition. She was Josephine Bracken, the
                adopted daughter of George Taufer from Hong Kong, who came to
                Dapitan to seek Rizal for eye treatment. Rizal was physically
                attracted to her. His loneliness and boredom must have taken the
                measure of him an of some incidence, which might have shocked or
                frightened her.
