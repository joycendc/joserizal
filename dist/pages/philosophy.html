        <h1 class="mb">Philosophies in Life</h1>
        <p class="mb">
          PHILOSOPHY may be defined as the study and pursuit of facts which deal
          with the ultimate reality or causes of things as they affect life.
          <br /><br />The philosophy of a country like the Philippines is made
          up of the intricate and composite interrelationship of the life
          histories of its people; in other word, the philosophy of our nation
          would be strange and undefinable if we do not delve into the past tied
          up with the notable life experiences of the representative
          personalities of our nation.

          <br /><br />Being one of the prominent representatives of Filipino
          personalities, Jose Rizal is a fit subject whose life philosophy
          deserves to be recognized.

          <br /><br />Having been a victim of Spanish brutality early in his
          life in Calamba, Rizal had thus already formed the nucleus of an
          unfavorable opinion of Castillian imperialistic administration of his
          country and people.

          <br /><br />Pitiful social conditions existed in the Philippines as
          late as three centuries after his conquest in Spain, with agriculture,
          commerce, communications and education languishing under its most
          backward state. It was because of this social malady that social evils
          like inferiority complex, cowardice, timidity and false pride pervaded
          nationally and contributed to the decay of social life. This
          stimulated and shaped Rizal’s life phylosophy to be to contain if not
          eliminate these social ills.

              <h1 class="name">Educational Philosophy</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                Rizal’s concept of the importance of education is clearly
                enunciated in his work entitled Instruction wherein he sought
                improvements in the schools and in the methods of teaching. He
                maintained that the backwardness of his country during the
                Spanish ear was not due to the Filipinos’ indifference, apathy
                or indolence as claimed by the rulers, but to the neglect of the
                Spanish authorities in the islands. For Rizal, the mission of
                education is to elevate the country to the highest seat of glory
                and to develop the people’s mentality. Since education is the
                foundation of society and a prerequisite for social progress,
                Rizal claimed that only through education could the country be
                saved from domination.

                <br /><br />Rizal’s philosophy of education, therefore, centers
                on the provision of proper motivation in order to bolster the
                great social forces that make education a success, to create in
                the youth an innate desire to cultivate his intelligence and
                give him life eternal.

              <h1 class="name">Religious Philosophy</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                Rizal grew up nurtured by a closely-knit Catholic family, was
                educated in the foremost Catholic schools of the period in the
                elementary, secondary and college levels; logically, therefore,
                he should have been a propagator of strictly Catholic
                traditions. However, in later life, he developed a life
                philosophy of a different nature, a philosophy of a different
                Catholic practice intermingled with the use of Truth and Reason.

                <br /><br />Why the change?

                <br /><br />It could have been the result of contemporary
                contact, companionship, observation, research and the possession
                of an independent spirit.Being a critical observer, a profound
                thinker and a zealous reformer, Rizal did not agree with the
                prevailing Christian propagation of the Faith by fire and sword.
                This is shown in his Annotation of Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas
                Filipinas.

                <br /><br />Rizal did not believe in the Catholic dogma that
                salvation was only for Catholics and that outside Christianity,
                salvation was not possible even if Catholics composed only a
                small minority of the world’s religious groups. Nor did he
                believe in the Catholic observation of fasting as a sacrifice,
                nor in the sale of such religious items as the cross, medals,
                rosaries and the like in order to propagate the Faith and raise
                church funds. He also lambasted the superstitious beliefs
                propagated by the priests in the church and in the schools. All
                of these and a lot more are evidences of Rizal’s religious
                philosophy.

              <h2 class="desc">
                In Rizal’s political view, a conquered country like the
                Philippines should not be taken advantage of but rather should
                be developed, civilized, educated and trained in the science of
                self-government.

                <br /><br />He bitterly assailed and criticized in publications
                the apparent backwardness of the Spanish ruler’s method of
                governing the country which resulted in:

                <br /><br />1. the bondage and slavery of the conquered ;

                <br /><br />2. the Spanish government’s requirement of forced
                labor and force military service upon the n natives;

                <br /><br />3. the abuse of power by means of exploitation;

                <br /><br />4. the government ruling that any complaint against
                the authorities was criminal; and

                <br /><br />5. Making the people ignorant, destitute and
                fanatic, thus discouraging the formation of a national
                sentiment.

                <br /><br />Rizal’s guiding political philosophy proved to be
                the study and application of reforms, the extension of human
                rights, the training for self government and the arousing of
                spirit of discontent over oppression, brutality, inhumanity,
                sensitiveness and self love.

              <h1 class="name">Ethical Philosophy</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                The study of human behavior as to whether it is good or bad or
                whether it is right or wrong is that science upon which Rizal’s
                ethical philosophy was based. The fact that the Philippines was
                under Spanish domination during Rizal’s time led him to
                subordinate his philosophy to moral problems. This trend was
                much more needed at that time because the Spaniards and the
                Filipinos had different and sometimes conflicting morals. The
                moral status of the Philippines during this period was one with
                a lack of freedom, one with predominance of foreign masters, one
                with an imposition of foreign religious worship, devotion,
                homage and racial habits. This led to moral confusion among the
                people, what with justice being stifled, limited or curtailed
                and the people not enjoying any individual rights.

                <br /><br />To bolster his ethical philosophy, Dr. Rizal had
                recognized not only the forces of good and evil, but also the
                tendencies towards good and evil. As a result, he made use of
                the practical method of appealing to the better nature of the
                conquerors and of offering useful methods of solving the moral
                problems of the conquered.

                <br /><br />To support his ethical philosophy in life, Rizal:

                <br /><br />1. censured the friars for abusing the advantage of
                their position as spiritual leaders and the ignorance and
                fanaticism of the natives;

                <br /><br />2. counseled the Filipinos not to resent a defect
                attributed to them but to accept same as reasonable and just;

                <br /><br />3. advised the masses that the object of marriage
                was the happiness and love of the couple and not financial gain;

                <br /><br />4. censured the priests who preached greed and wrong
                morality; and

                <br /><br />5. advised every one that love and respect for
                parents must be strictly observed.

                That body of knowledge relating to society including the wisdom
                which man's experience in society has taught him is social
                philosophy. The facts dealt with are principles involved in
                nation building and not individual social problems. The subject
                matter of this social philosophy covers the problems of the
                whole race, with every problem having a distinct solution to
                bolster the people’s social knowledge.

                <br /><br />Rizal’s social philosophy dealt with;

                <br /><br />1. man in society; <br /><br />2. influential
                factors in human life; <br /><br />3. racial problems;
                <br /><br />
                4. social constant; <br /><br />5. social justice; <br /><br />
                6. social ideal; <br /><br />
                7. poverty and wealth; <br /><br />
                8. reforms; <br /><br />
                9. youth and greatness; <br /><br />
                10. history and progress; <br /><br />
                11. future Philippines.

                <br /><br />
                The above dealt with man’s evolution and his environment,
                explaining for the most part human behavior and capacities like
                his will to live; his desire to possess happiness; the change of
                his mentality; the role of virtuous women in the guidance of
                great men; the need for elevating and inspiring mission; the
                duties and dictates of man’s conscience; man’s need of
                practicing gratitude; the necessity for consulting reliable
                people; his need for experience; his ability to deny; the
                importance of deliberation; the voluntary offer of man’s
                abilities and possibilities; the ability to think, aspire and
                strive to rise; and the proper use of hearth, brain and
                spirit-all of these combining to enhance the intricacies, beauty
                and values of human nature. All of the above served as Rizal’s
                guide in his continuous effort to make over his beloved
                Philippines.
