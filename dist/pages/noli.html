        <h1 class="mb">Noli Me Tangere</h1>
        <p>
          Spain, to Rizal, was a venue for realizing his dreams. He finished his
          studies in Madrid and this to him was the realization of the bigger
          part of his ambition. His vision broadened while he was in Spain to
          the point of awakening in him an understanding of human nature,
          sparking in him the realization that his people needed him. It must
          have been this sentiment that prompted him to pursue, during the
          re-organizational meeting of the Circulo-Hispano-Filipino, to be one
          of its activities, the publication of a book to which all the members
          would contribute papers on the various aspects and conditions of
          Philippines life.

          <br /><br />"My proposal on the book," he wrote on January 2, 1884,
          "was unanimously approved. But afterwards difficulties and objections
          were raised which seemed to me rather odd, and a number of gentlemen
          stood up and refused to discuss the matter any further. In view of
          this I decided not ance, then challenge us and we shall pick up the
          gauntlet, for we are not cowards like you, which is not to say that a
          hidden hand will not put an end to your life."

          <br /><br />A special committee of the faculty of the University of
          Santo Tomas, at the request of the Archbishop Pedro Payo, found and
          condemned the novel as heretical, impious, and scandalous in its
          religious aspect, and unpatriotic, subversive of public order and
          harmful to the Spanish government and its administration of theses
          islands in its political aspect.

          <br /><br />On December 28, 1887, Fray Salvador Font, the cura of
          Tondo and chairman of the Permanent Commission of Censorship composed
          of laymen and ordered that the circulation of this pernicious book" be
          absolutely prohibited.

          <br /><br />Not content, Font caused the circulation of copies of the
          prohibition, an act which brought an effect contrary to what he
          desired. Instead of what he expected, the negative publicity awakened
          more the curiosity of the people who managed to get copies of the
          book.Men regularly in the action begins within 64 in thepart of the
          question. All facts:

          <br /><br />Assisting Father Font in his aim to discredit the Noli was
          an Augustinian friar by the name of Jose Rodriguez. In a pamphlet
          entitled Caiingat Cayo (Beware). Fr. Rodriguez warned the people that
          in reading the book they "commit mortal sin," considering that it was
          full of heresy.

          <br /><br />As far as Madrid, there was furor over the Noli, as
          evidenced by an article which bitterly criticized the novel published
          in a Madrid newspaper in January, 1890, and written by one Vicente
          Barrantes. In like manner, a member of the Senate in the Spanish
          Cortes assailed the novel as "anti-Catholic, Protestant, socialistic."

          <br /><br />It is well to note that not detractors alone visibly
          reacted to the effects of the Noli. For if there were bitter critics,
          another group composed of staunch defenders found every reason to
          justify its publication and circulation Consequently, realizing how
          much the Noli had awakened his countrymen, to the point of defending
          his novel, Rizal said: "Now I die content."

          <br /><br />Fittingly, Rizal found it a timely and effective gesture
          to dedicate his novel to the country of his people whose experiences
          and sufferings he wrote about, sufferings which he brought to light in
          an effort to awaken his countrymen to the truths that had long
          remained unspoken, although not totally unheard of.
