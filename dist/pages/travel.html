                was accompanied to the quay where the Salvadora was moored by
                his uncle Antonio, Vicente Gella, and Mateo Evangelista.

                On his way to Marseilles, Rizal had a terrible dream. He dreamed
                he was traveling with Neneng (Saturnina) and their path was
                blocked by snakes.

                Rizal had another disheartening dream. He dreamed he returned to
                Calamba and after meeting his parents who did not talk to him
                because of not having consulted them about his first trip
                abroad, he returned traveling abroad with one hundred pesos he
                again borrowed. He was so sad and broken hearted. Soon he woke
                up and found himself inside his cabin.
