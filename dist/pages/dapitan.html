        <h1 class="mb">Peaceful life in Dapitan</h1>
        <p>
          During the early part of his exile in Dapitan, Rizal lived at the
          commandantâ€™s residence. With his prize from the Manila Lottery and his
          earnings as a farmer and a merchant, he bought a piece of land near
          the shore of Talisay near Dapitan. On this land, he built three
          houses- all made of bamboo, wood, and nipa. The first house which was
          square in shape was his home. The second house was the living quarters
          of his pupils. And the third house was the barn where he kept his
          chickens. The second house had eight sides, while the third had six
          sides.

          <br /><br />In a latter to his friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt, on
          December 19, 1893, Rizal described his peaceful life in Dapitan.

          <br /><br />"I shall tell you how we lived here. I have three
          houses-one square, another hexagonal, and the third octagonal. All
          these houses are made of bamboo, wood, and nipa. I live in the square
          house, together with my mother, my sister, Trinidad, and my nephew. In
          the octagonal house live some young boys who are my pupils. The
          hexagonal house is my barn where I keep my chickens.

          <br /><br />"From my house, I hear the murmur of a clear brook which
          comes from the high rocks. I see the seashore where I keep two boats,
          which are called barotos here.

          <br /><br />"I have many fruit trees, such as mangoes, lanzones,
          guayabanos, baluno, nangka, etc. I have rabbits, dogs, cats, and other
          animals.

          <br /><br />"I rise early in the morning-at five-visit my plants, feed
          the chickens, awaken my people, and prepare our breakfast. At
          half-past seven, we eat our breakfast, which consists of tea, bread,
          cheese, sweets, and other things.

          <br /><br />"After breakfast, I treat the poor patients who come to my
          house. Then I dress and go to Dapitan in my baroto. I am busy the
          whole morning, attending to my patients in town.

          <br /><br />"At noon, I return home to Talisay for lunch. Then, from
          2:00 to 4:00 p.m., I am busy as a teacher. I teach the young boys.

          <br /><br />"I spend the rest of the afternoon in farming. My pupils
          help me in watering the plants, pruning the fruits, and planting many
          kinds of trees. We stop at 6:00 p.m. for the Angelus

          <br /><br />"I spend the night reading and writing."
