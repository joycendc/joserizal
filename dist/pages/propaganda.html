        <h1 class="mb">Rizal and the Propaganda Movement</h1>
        <p>
          To prove his point and refute the accusations of prejudiced Spanish
          writers against his race, Rizal annotated the book, Sucesos de las
          Islas Filipinas, written by the Spaniard Antonio Morga. The book was
          an unbiased presentation of 16th century Filipino culture. Rizal
          through his annotation showed that Filipinos had developed culture
          even before the coming of the Spaniards.

          <br /><br />While annotating Morga’s book, he began writing the sequel
          to the Noli, the El Filibusterismo. He completed the Fili in July 1891
          while he was in Brussels, Belgium. As in the printing of the Noli,
          Rizal could not published the sequel for the lack of finances.
          Fortunately, Valentin Ventura gave him financial assistance and the
          Fili came out of the printing press on September 1891.

          <br /><br />The El Filibusterismo indicated Spanish colonial policies
          and attacked the Filipino collaborators of such system. The novel
          pictured a society on the brink of a revolution.

          <br /><br />To buttress his defense of the native’s pride and dignity
          as people, Rizal wrote three significant essays while abroad: The
          Philippines a Century hence, the Indolence of the Filipinos and the
          Letter to the Women of Malolos. These writings were his brilliant
          responses to the vicious attacks against the Indio and his culture.

          <br /><br />While in Hongkong, Rizal planned the founding of the Liga
          Filipina, a civil organization and the establishment of a Filipino
          colony in Borneo. The colony was to be under the protectorate of the
          North Borneo Company, he was granted permission by the British
          Governor to establish a settlement on a 190,000 acre property in North
          Borneo. The colony was to be under the protectorate of the North
          Borneo Company, with the "same privileges and conditions at those
          given in the treaty with local Bornean rulers".

          <br /><br />Governor Eulogio Despujol disapproved the project for
          obvious and self-serving reasons. He considered the plan impractical
          and improper that Filipinos would settle and develop foreign
          territories while the colony itself badly needed such developments.
