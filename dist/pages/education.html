        <h1 class="mb">Early Education in Calamba and Biñan</h1>
        <p class="mb">
          Rizal had his early education in Calamba and Biñan. It was a typical
          schooling that a son of an ilustrado family received during his time,
          characterized by the four R’s- reading, writing, arithmetic, and
          religion. Instruction was rigid and strict. Knowledge was forced into
          the minds of the pupils by means of the tedious memory method aided by
          the teacher’s whip. Despite the defects of the Spanish system of
          elementary education, Rizal was able to acquire the necessary
          instruction preparatory for college work in Manila. It may be said
          that Rizal, who was born a physical weakling, rose to become an
          intellectual giant not because of, but rather in spite of, the
          outmoded and backward system of instruction obtaining in the
          Philippines during the last decades of Spanish regime.

              <h1 class="name">The Hero’s First Teacher</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                The first teacher of Rizal was his mother, who was a remarkable
                woman of good character and fine culture. On her lap, he learned
                at the age of three the alphabet and the prayers. "My mother,"
                wrote Rizal in his student memoirs, "taught me how to read and
                to say haltingly the humble prayers which I raised fervently to
                God."

                <br /><br />As tutor, Doña Teodora was patient, conscientious,
                and understanding. It was she who first discovered that her son
                had a talent for poetry. Accordingly, she encouraged him to
                write poems. To lighten the monotony of memorizing the ABC’s and
                to stimulate her son’s imagination, she related many stories.

                <br /><br />As Jose grew older, his parents employed private
                tutors to give him lessons at home. The first was Maestro
                Celestino and the second, Maestro Lucas Padua. Later, an old man
                named Leon Monroy, a former classmate of Rizal’s father, became
                the boy’s tutor. This old teacher lived at the Rizal home and
                instructed Jose in Spanish and Latin. Unfortunately, he did not
                lived long. He died five months later.

                <br /><br />After a Monroy’s death, the hero’s parents decided
                to send their gifted son to a private school in Biñan.

              <h1 class="name">Jose Goes to Biñan</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                One Sunday afternoon in June , 1869, Jose, after kissing the
                hands of his parents and a tearful parting from his sister, left
                Calamba for Biñan. He was accompanied by Paciano , who acted as
                his second father. The two brothers rode in a carromata,
                reaching their destination after one and one-half hours’ drive.
                They proceeded to their aunt’s house, where Jose was to lodge.
                It was almost night when they arrived, and the moon was about to
                rise.

                <br /><br />That same night, Jose, with his cousin named
                Leandro, went sightseeing in the town. Instead of enjoying the
                sights, Jose became depressed because of homesickness. "In the
                moonlight," he recounted, "I remembered my home town, my
                idolized mother, and my solicitous sisters. Ah, how sweet to me
                was Calamba, my own town, in spite of the fact that was not as
                wealthy as Biñan."

              <h1 class="name">First Day in Biñan School</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                The next morning (Monday) Paciano brought his younger brother to
                the school of Maestro Justiniano Aquino Cruz.

                <br /><br />The school was in the house of the teacher, which
                was a small nipa hut about 30 meters from the home of Jose’s
                aunt.

                <br /><br />Paciano knew the teacher quite well because he had
                been a pupil under him before. He introduced Jose to the
                teacher, after which he departed to return to Calamba.

                <br /><br />
                Immediately, Jose was assigned his seat in the class. The
                teacher asked him:

                <br /><br />"Do you know Spanish?" <br /><br />"A little, sir,"
                replied the Calamba lad. <br /><br />"Do you know Latin?"
                <br /><br />"A little, sir."

                <br /><br />The boys in the class, especially Pedro, the
                teacher’s son laughed at Jose’s answers.

                <br /><br />
                The teacher sharply stopped all noises and begun the lessons of
                the day.

                <br /><br />Jose described his teacher in Biñan as follows: "He
                was tall, thin, long-necked, with sharp nose and a body slightly
                bent forward, and he used to wear a sinamay shirt, woven by the
                skilled hands of the women of Batangas. He knew by the heart the
                grammars by Nebrija and Gainza. Add to this severity that in my
                judgement was exaggerated and you have a picture, perhaps vague,
                that I have made of him, but I remember only this."

                <br /><br />First School Brawl In the afternoon of his first day
                in school, when the teacher was having his siesta, Jose met the
                bully, Pedro. He was angry at this bully for making fun of him
                during his conversation with the teacher in the morning.

                <br /><br />Jose challenged Pedro to a fight. The latter readily
                accepted, thinking that he could easily beat the Calamba boy who
                was smaller and younger.

                <br /><br />The two boys wrestled furiously in the classroom,
                much to the glee of their classmates. Jose, having learned the
                art of wrestling from his athletic Tio Manuel, defeated the
                bigger boy. For this feat, he became popular among his
                classmates.

                <br /><br />After the class in the afternoon, a classmate named
                Andres Salandanan challenged him to an arm-wrestling match. They
                went to a sidewalk of a house and wrestled with their arms.
                Jose, having the weaker arm, lost and nearly cracked his head on
                the sidewalk.

                <br /><br />In succeeding days he had other fights with the boys
                of Biñan. He was not quarrelsome by nature, but he never ran
                away from a fight.

              <h2 class="desc">
                In academic studies, Jose beat all Biñan boys. He surpassed them
                all in Spanish, Latin, and other subjects.

                <br /><br />Some of his older classmates were jealous of his
                intellectual superiority. They wickedly squealed to the teacher
                whenever Jose had a fight outside the school, and even told lies
                to discredit him before the teacher’s eyes. Consequently the
                teacher had to punish Jose.

              <h1 class="name">Early Schooling in Biñan</h1>
              <h2 class="desc">
                Jose had a very vivid imagination and a very keen sense of
                observation. At the age of seven he traveled with his father for
                the first time to Manila and thence to Antipolo to fulfill the
                promise of a pilgrimage made by his mother at the time of his
                birth. They embarked in a casco, a very ponderous vessel
                commonly used in the Philippines. It was the first trip on the
                lake that Jose could recollect. As darkness fell he spent the
                hours by the katig, admiring the grandeur of the water and the
                stillness of the night, although he was seized with a
                superstitious fear when he saw a water snake entwine itself
                around the bamboo beams of the katig. With what joy did he see
                the sun at the daybreak as its luminous rays shone upon the
                glistening surface of the wide lake, producing a brilliant
                effect! With what joy did he talk to his father, for he had not
                uttered a word during the night!

                <br /><br />When they proceeded to Antipolo, he experienced the
                sweetest emotions upon seeing the gay banks of the Pasig and the
                towns of Cainta and Taytay. In Antipolo he prayed, kneeling
                before the image of the Virgin of Peace and Good Voyage, of whom
                he would later sing in elegant verses. Then he saw Manila, the
                great metropolis , with its Chinese sores and European bazaars.
                And visited his elder sister, Saturnina, in Santa Ana, who was a
                boarding student in the Concordia College.

                <br /><br />When he was nine years old, his father sent him to
                Biñan to continue studying Latin, because his first teacher had
                died. His brother Paciano took him to Biñan one Sunday, and Jose
                bade his parents and sisters good-bye with tears in his eyes.
                Oh, how it saddened him to leave for the first time and live far
                from his home and his family! But he felt ashamed to cry and had
                to conceal his tears and sentiments. "O Shame," he explained,
                "how many beautiful and pathetic scenes the world would witness
                without thee!"

                <br /><br />They arrived at Biñan in the evening. His brother
                took him to the house of his aunt where he was to stay, and left
                him after introducing him to the teacher. At night, in company
                with his aunt’s grandson named Leandro, Jose took a walk around
                the town in the light of the moon. To him the town looked
                extensive and rich but sad and ugly.

                <br /><br />His teacher in Biñan was a severe disciplinarian.
                His name was Justiniano Aquino Cruz. "He was a tall man, lean
                and long-necked, with a sharp nose and a body slightly bent
                forward. He used to wear a sinamay shirt woven by the deft hands
                of Batangas women. He knew by memory the grammars of Nebrija and
                Gainza. To this add a severity which, in my judgement I have
                made of him, which is all I remember."

                <br /><br />The boy Jose distinguished himself in class, and
                succeeded in surpassing many of his older classmates. Some of
                these were so wicked that, even without reason, they accused him
                before the teacher, for which, in spite of his progress, he
                received many whippings and strokes from the ferule. Rare was
                the day when he was not stretched on the bench for a whipping or
                punished with five or six blows on the open palm. Jose’s
                reaction to all these punishments was one of intense resentment
                in order to learn and thus carry out his father’s will.

                <br /><br />Jose spent his leisure hours with Justiniano’s
                father-in-law, a master painter. From him he took his first two
                sons, two nephews, and a grandson. His way life was methodical
                and well regulated. He heard mass at four if there was one that
                early, or studied his lesson at that hour and went to mass
                afterwards. Returning home, he might look in the orchard for a
                mambolo fruit to eat, then he took his breakfast, consisting
                generally of a plate of rice and two dried sardines.

                <br /><br />After that he would go to class, from which he was
                dismissed at ten, then home again. He ate with his aunt and then
                began at ten, then home again. He ate with his aunt and then
                began to study. At half past two he returned to class and left
                at five. He might play for a short time with some cousins before
                returning home. He studied his lessons, drew for a while, and
                then prayed and if there was a moon, his friends would invite
                him to play in the street in company with other boys.

                <br /><br />Whenever he remembered his town, he thought with
                tears in his eyes of his beloved father, his idolized mother,
                and his solicitous sisters. Ah, how sweet was his town even
                though not so opulent as Biñan! He grew sad and thoughtful.

                <br /><br />While he was studying in Biñan, he returned to his
                hometown now and then. How long the road seemed to him in going
                and how short in coming! When from afar he descried the roof of
                his house, secret joy filled his breast. How he looked for
                pretexts to remain longer at home! A day more seemed to him a
                day spent in heaven, and how he wept, though silently and
                secretly, when he saw the calesa that was flower that him Biñan!
                Then everything looked sad; a flower that he touched, a stone
                that attracted his attention he gathered, fearful that he might
                not see it again upon his return. It was a sad but delicate and
                quite pain that possessed him.
