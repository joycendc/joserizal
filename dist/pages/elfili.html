          ALL ABOUT JOSE RIZAL

        <h1 class="mb">El Filibustersimo</h1>
        <p>
          The word "filibustero" wrote Rizal to his friend, Ferdinand
          Blumentritt, is very little known in the Philippines. The masses do
          not know it yet.

          <br /><br />Jose Alejandro, one of the new Filipinos who had been
          quite intimate with Rizal, said, "in writing the Noli Rizal signed his
          own death warrant." Subsequent events, after the fate of the Noli was
          sealed by the Spanish authorities, prompted Rizal to write the
          continuation of his first novel. He confessed, however, that regretted
          very much having killed Elias instead of Ibarra, reasoning that when
          he published the Noli his health was very much broken, and was very
          unsure of being able to write the continuation and speak of a
          revolution.

          <br /><br />Explaining to Marcelo H. del Pilar his inability to
          contribute articles to the La Solidaridad, Rizal said that he was
          haunted by certain sad presentiments, and that he had been dreaming
          almost every night of dead relatives and friends a few days before his
          29th birthday, that is why he wanted to finish the second part of the
          Noli at all costs.

          <br /><br />Consequently, as expected of a determined character, Rizal
          apparently went in writing, for to his friend, Blumentritt, he wrote
          on March 29, 1891: "I have finished my book. Ah! I’ve not written it
          with any idea of vengeance against my enemies, but only for the good
          of those who suffer and for the rights of Tagalog humanity, although
          brown and not good-looking."

          <br /><br />To a Filipino friend in Hong Kong, Jose Basa, Rizal
          likewise eagerly announced the completion of his second novel. Having
          moved to Ghent to have the book published at cheaper cost, Rizal once
          more wrote his friend, Basa, in Hongkong on July 9, 1891: "I am not
          sailing at once, because I am now printing the second part of the Noli
          here, as you may see from the enclosed pages. I prefer to publish it
          in some other way before leaving Europe, for it seemed to me a pity
          not to do so. For the past three months I have not received a single
          centavo, so I have pawned all that I have in order to publish this
          book. I will continue publishing it as long as I can; and when there
          is nothing to pawn I will stop and return to be at your side."

          <br /><br />Inevitably, Rizal’s next letter to Basa contained the
          tragic news of the suspension of the printing of the sequel to his
          first novel due to lack of funds, forcing him to stop and leave the
          book half-way. "It is a pity," he wrote Basa, "because it seems to me
          that this second part is more important than the first, and if I do
          not finish it here, it will never be finished."

          <br /><br />Fortunately, Rizal was not to remain in despair for long.
          A compatriot, Valentin Ventura, learned of Rizal’s predicament. He
          offered him financial assistance. Even then Rizal’s was forced to
          shorten the novel quite drastically, leaving only thirty-eight
          chapters compared to the sixty-four chapters of the first novel.

          <br /><br />Rizal moved to Ghent, and writes Jose Alejandro. The
          sequel to Rizal’s Noli came off the press by the middle of September,
          1891.On the 18th he sent Basa two copies, and Valentin Ventura the
          original manuscript and an autographed printed copy.

          <br /><br />Inspired by what the word filibustero connoted in relation
          to the circumstances obtaining in his time, and his spirits dampened
          by the tragic execution of the three martyred priests, Rizal aptly
          titled the second part of the Noli Me Tangere, El Filibusterismo. In
          veneration of the three priests, he dedicated the book to them.

          <br /><br />"To the memory of the priests, Don Mariano Gomez (85 years
          old), Don Jose Burgos (30 years old), and Don Jacinto Zamora (35 years
          old). Executed in the Bagumbayan Field on the 28th of February, 1872."

          <br /><br />"The church, by refusing to degrade you, has placed in
          doubt the crime that has been imputed to you; the Government, by
          surrounding your trials with mystery and shadows causes the belief
          that there was some error, committed in fatal moments; and all the
          Philippines, by worshipping your memory and calling you martyrs, in no
          sense recognizes your culpability. In so far, therefore, as your
          complicity in the Cavite Mutiny is not clearly proved, as you may or
          may not have been patriots, and as you may or may not cherished
          sentiments for justice and for liberty, I have the right to dedicate
          my work to you as victims of the evil which I undertake to combat. And
          while we await expectantly upon Spain some day to restore your good
          name and cease to be answerable for your death, let these pages serve
          as a tardy wreath of dried leaves over one who without clear proofs
          attacks your memory stains his hands in your blood."

          <br /><br />Rizal’s memory seemed to have failed him, though, for
          Father Gomez was then 73 not 85, Father Burgos 35 not 30 Father Zamora
          37 not 35; and the date of execution 17th not 28th.

          <br /><br />The FOREWORD of the Fili was addressed to his beloved
          countrymen, thus:

          <br /><br />"TO THE FILIPINO PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENT"
